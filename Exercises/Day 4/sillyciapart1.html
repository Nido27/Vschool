            <p><b>LANGLEY, VA—A</b> report released Tuesday by the <b>CIA's</b> Office of the Inspector General revealed that the <br/>CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black <br/>highlighters.</p>

<p>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred <br/>by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that <br/>began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

<p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b>lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several <br/> historic events, such as:<br/> </p>
            <ul>
                <li>the Cold War</li>
                <li>the civil-rights movement </li>
                <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
            </ul>
